(a) This motion shall affect the Supreme Court, the federal courts, and any other court of the United States with federal jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S. Code § 2072.


(b) Admissible evidence shall be defined as the following:
1. In-Site evidence shall be defined as any evidence collected from the Roblox platform (i.e: Roblox games, Roblox forums, Roblox groups, etc.)
2. Off-Site evidence be defined as any evidence primarily collected outside of Roblox and exclusively in the following platforms: Discord, X (formerly Twitter) and Youtube.
    - (i) This type of evidence should only be admissible if the off-site page is refreshed and the evidence is showed twice.
    - (ii) Still screenshot images shall not be admissible in any court under U.S. Code § 2072.


(c) New evidence may not be presented within thirty-six (36) hours of a trial, nor may it be presented within twenty-four (24) hours of a substantial hearing, such as a preliminary hearing. (For the purposes of this motion, the main hearing in a Supreme Court case will be considered a trial.)

(d) Evidence must be collected in a legal and ethical manner. Illegally-obtained evidence (fruit of the poisonous tree) will not be admissible. Unethically-obtained evidence may be dismissed at the judge's discretion.

(e) In-site evidence that qualifies under Sections c and d of this rule shall not be inadmissible under any circumstances, excepting extenuating circumstances at the judge's discretion.

(f) Off-site evidence must contain reliable proof that an online account indeed belongs to the subject and is not a fraudulent account and that such message was made by that account. Off-site evidence must be obtained exclusively through a video to validate the previously noted requirements. To make sure evidence is allowed the video needs to show the person or account, the message, and the program or application the evidence is being gathered on must be refreshed. This can be done on most programs and applications–such as discord and various browsers–by pressing 'Ctrl' and 'R' in sequence. No evidence as described in this secrion shall be admissible if this action has not been done.

(g) Off-site evidence that qualifies under Sections c, d, and f of this rule shall not be inadmissible under any circumstances, excepting extenuating circumstances at the judge's discretion.

(h) This motion is effective immediately after passage and shall not expire and it shall not affect current cases filed before April 6th, 2024 in the Supreme Court, the federal courts or any other courts with federal jurisdiction, persuant to U.S. Code § 2072.
