The following definitions apply under this article:


(a) Statement. “Statement” means a person’s oral assertion, written assertion, or nonverbal conduct, if the person intended it as an assertion.


(b) Declarant. “Declarant” means the person who made the statement.


(c) Hearsay. “Hearsay” means a statement that:


1. the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing; and


2. a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.


(d) Statements That Are Not Hearsay. A statement that meets the following conditions is not hearsay:


1. A Declarant-Witness’s Prior Statement. The declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination about a prior statement, and the statement:


    - (A) is inconsistent with the declarant’s testimony and was given under penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding or in a deposition;


    - (B) is consistent with the declarant’s testimony and is offered:


        - (i) to rebut an express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated it or acted from a recent improper influence or motive in so testifying; or


        - (ii) to rehabilitate the declarant’s credibility as a witness when attacked on another ground; or


    - (C) identifies a person as someone the declarant perceived earlier.


2. An Opposing Party’s Statement. The statement is offered against an opposing party and:


    - (A) was made by the party in an individual or representative capacity;


    - (B) is one the party manifested that it adopted or believed to be true;


    - (C) was made by a person whom the party authorized to make a statement on the subject;


    - (D) was made by the party’s agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed; or


    - (E) was made by the party’s coconspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.


The statement must be considered but does not by itself establish the declarant’s authority under (C); the existence or scope of the relationship under (D); or the existence of the conspiracy or participation in it under (E).
