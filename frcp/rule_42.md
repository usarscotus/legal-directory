(a) Consolidation. If actions before the court involve a common question of law or fact, the court may:


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) join for hearing or trial any or all matters at issue in the actions;


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) consolidate the actions; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) issue any other orders to avoid unnecessary cost or delay.


(b) Separate Trials. For convenience, to avoid prejudice, or to expedite and economize, the court may order a separate trial of one or more separate issues, claims, crossclaims, counterclaims, or third-party claims. When ordering a separate trial, the court must preserve any federal right to a jury trial.
