(a) Intervention of Right. On timely motion, the court must permit anyone to intervene who:


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) is given an unconditional right to intervene by a federal statute; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant's ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.


(b) Permissive Intervention.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In General. On timely motion, the court may permit anyone to intervene who:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) is given a conditional right to intervene by a federal statute; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) By a Government Officer or Agency. On timely motion, the court may permit a federal or state governmental officer or agency to intervene if a party's claim or defense is based on:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) a statute or executive order administered by the officer or agency; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) any regulation, order, requirement, or agreement issued or made under the statute or executive order.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Delay or Prejudice. In exercising its discretion, the court must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original partiesâ€™ rights.


(c) Notice and Pleading Required. A motion to intervene must be served on the parties as provided in Rule 5 . The motion must state the grounds for intervention and be accompanied by a pleading that sets out the claim or defense for which intervention is sought.
