2. reading the indictment or information to the defendant or stating to the defendant the substance of the charge; and then


3. asking the defendant to plead to the indictment or information.


(b) Waiving Appearance. A defendant need not be present for the arraignment if:


1. the defendant has been charged by indictment or misdemeanor information;


2. the defendant, in a written waiver signed by both the defendant and defense counsel, has waived appearance and has affirmed that the defendant received a copy of the indictment or information and that the plea is not guilty; and


3. the court accepts the waiver.
