(a) Claim for Relief. A pleading that states a claim for relief must contain:


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) a short and plain statement of the grounds for the court's jurisdiction, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new jurisdictional support;


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) a demand for the relief sought, which may include relief in the alternative or different types of relief.


(b) Defenses; Admissions and Denials.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In General. In responding to a pleading, a party must:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) state in short and plain terms its defenses to each claim asserted against it; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) admit or deny the allegations asserted against it by an opposing party.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Denials—Responding to the Substance. A denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) General and Specific Denials. A party that intends in good faith to deny all the allegations of a pleading—including the jurisdictional grounds—may do so by a general denial. A party that does not intend to deny all the allegations must either specifically deny designated allegations or generally deny all except those specifically admitted.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Denying Part of an Allegation. A party that intends in good faith to deny only part of an allegation must admit the part that is true and deny the rest.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Lacking Knowledge or Information. A party that lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation must so state, and the statement has the effect of a denial.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Effect of Failing to Deny. An allegation—other than one relating to the amount of damages—is admitted if a responsive pleading is required and the allegation is not denied. If a responsive pleading is not required, an allegation is considered denied or avoided.


(c) Affirmative Defenses.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In General. In responding to a pleading, a party must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense, including:


• accord and satisfaction;


• arbitration and award;


• assumption of risk;


• contributory negligence;


• duress;


• estoppel;


• failure of consideration;


• fraud;


• illegality;


• injury by fellow servant;


• laches;


• license;


• payment;


• release;


• res judicata;


• statute of frauds;


• statute of limitations; and


• waiver.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Mistaken Designation. If a party mistakenly designates a defense as a counterclaim, or a counterclaim as a defense, the court must, if justice requires, treat the pleading as though it were correctly designated, and may impose terms for doing so.


(d) Pleading to Be Concise and Direct; Alternative Statements; Inconsistency.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In General. Each allegation must be simple, concise, and direct. No technical form is required.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Alternative Statements of a Claim or Defense. A party may set out 2 or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically, either in a single count or defense or in separate ones. If a party makes alternative statements, the pleading is sufficient if any one of them is sufficient.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Inconsistent Claims or Defenses. A party may state as many separate claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency.


(e) Construing Pleadings. Pleadings must be construed so as to do justice.
