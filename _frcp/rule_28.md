(a) Within the United States.


1. In General. Within the United States or a territory or insular possession subject to United States jurisdiction, a deposition must be taken before:


    - (A) an officer authorized to administer oaths either by federal law or by the law in the place of examination; or


    - (B) a person appointed by the court where the action is pending to administer oaths and take testimony.


2. Definition of “Officer.” The term “officer” in Rules 30 , 31 , and 32 includes a person appointed by the court under this rule or designated by the parties under Rule 29(a) .


(b) In a Foreign Country.


1. In General. A deposition may be taken in a foreign country:


    - (A) under an applicable treaty or convention;


    - (B) under a letter of request, whether or not captioned a “letter rogatory”;


    - (C) on notice, before a person authorized to administer oaths either by federal law or by the law in the place of examination; or


    - (D) before a person commissioned by the court to administer any necessary oath and take testimony.


2. Issuing a Letter of Request or a Commission. A letter of request, a commission, or both may be issued:


    - (A) on appropriate terms after an application and notice of it; and


    - (B) without a showing that taking the deposition in another manner is impracticable or inconvenient.


3. Form of a Request, Notice, or Commission. When a letter of request or any other device is used according to a treaty or convention, it must be captioned in the form prescribed by that treaty or convention. A letter of request may be addressed “To the Appropriate Authority in [name of country].” A deposition notice or a commission must designate by name or descriptive title the person before whom the deposition is to be taken.


4. Letter of Request—Admitting Evidence. Evidence obtained in response to a letter of request need not be excluded merely because it is not a verbatim transcript, because the testimony was not taken under oath, or because of any similar departure from the requirements for depositions taken within the United States.


(c) Disqualification. A deposition must not be taken before a person who is any party's relative, employee, or attorney; who is related to or employed by any party's attorney; or who is financially interested in the action.


ule 29. Stipulations About Discovery Procedure


Unless the court orders otherwise, the parties may stipulate that:


(a) a deposition may be taken before any person, at any time or place, on any notice, and in the manner specified—in which event it may be used in the same way as any other deposition; and


(b) other procedures governing or limiting discovery be modified—but a stipulation extending the time for any form of discovery must have court approval if it would interfere with the time set for completing discovery, for hearing a motion, or for trial.Rule 30. Depositions by Oral Examination


(a) When a Deposition May Be Taken.


1. Without Leave. A party may, by oral questions, depose any person, including a party, without leave of court except as provided in Rule 30(a)(2). The deponent's attendance may be compelled by subpoena under Rule 45 .


2. With Leave. A party must obtain leave of court, and the court must grant leave to the extent consistent with Rule 26(b)(1) and (2) :


    - (A) if the parties have not stipulated to the deposition and:


        - (i) the deposition would result in more than 10 depositions being taken under this rule or Rule 31 by the plaintiffs, or by the defendants, or by the third-party defendants;


        - (ii) the deponent has already been deposed in the case; or


        - (iii) the party seeks to take the deposition before the time specified in Rule 26(d) , unless the party certifies in the notice, with supporting facts, that the deponent is expected to leave the United States and be unavailable for examination in this country after that time; or


    - (B) if the deponent is confined in prison.


(b) Notice of the Deposition; Other Formal Requirements.


1. Notice in General. A party who wants to depose a person by oral questions must give reasonable written notice to every other party. The notice must state the time and place of the deposition and, if known, the deponent's name and address. If the name is unknown, the notice must provide a general description sufficient to identify the person or the particular class or group to which the person belongs.


2. Producing Documents. If a subpoena duces tecum is to be served on the deponent, the materials designated for production, as set out in the subpoena, must be listed in the notice or in an attachment. The notice to a party deponent may be accompanied by a request under Rule 34 to produce documents and tangible things at the deposition.


3. Method of Recording.


    - (A) Method Stated in the Notice. The party who notices the deposition must state in the notice the method for recording the testimony. Unless the court orders otherwise, testimony may be recorded by audio, audiovisual, or stenographic means. The noticing party bears the recording costs. Any party may arrange to transcribe a deposition.


    - (B) Additional Method. With prior notice to the deponent and other parties, any party may designate another method for recording the testimony in addition to that specified in the original notice. That party bears the expense of the additional record or transcript unless the court orders otherwise.


4. By Remote Means. The parties may stipulate—or the court may on motion order—that a deposition be taken by telephone or other remote means. For the purpose of this rule and Rules 28(a) , 37(a)(2), and 37(b)(1), the deposition takes place where the deponent answers the questions.


5. Officer's Duties.


    - (A) Before the Deposition. Unless the parties stipulate otherwise, a deposition must be conducted before an officer appointed or designated under Rule 28 . The officer must begin the deposition with an on-the-record statement that includes:


        - (i) the officer's name and business address;


        - (ii) the date, time, and place of the deposition;


        - (iii) the deponent's name;


        - (iv) the officer's administration of the oath or affirmation to the deponent; and


        - (v) the identity of all persons present.


    - (B) Conducting the Deposition; Avoiding Distortion. If the deposition is recorded nonstenographically, the officer must repeat the items in Rule 30(b)(5)(A)(i)–(iii) at the beginning of each unit of the recording medium. The deponent's and attorneys’ appearance or demeanor must not be distorted through recording techniques.


    - (C) After the Deposition. At the end of a deposition, the officer must state on the record that the deposition is complete and must set out any stipulations made by the attorneys about custody of the transcript or recording and of the exhibits, or about any other pertinent matters.


6. Notice or Subpoena Directed to an Organization. In its notice or subpoena, a party may name as the deponent a public or private corporation, a partnership, an association, a governmental agency, or other entity and must describe with reasonable particularity the matters for examination. The named organization must designate one or more officers, directors, or managing agents, or designate other persons who consent to testify on its behalf; and it may set out the matters on which each person designated will testify. Before or promptly after the notice or subpoena is served, the serving party and the organization must confer in good faith about the matters for examination. A subpoena must advise a nonparty organization of its duty to confer with the serving party and to designate each person who will testify. The persons designated must testify about information known or reasonably available to the organization. This paragraph (6) does not preclude a deposition by any other procedure allowed by these rules.


(c) Examination and Cross-Examination; Record of the Examination; Objections; Written Questions.


1. Examination and Cross-Examination. The examination and cross-examination of a deponent proceed as they would at trial under the Federal Rules of Evidence , except Rules 103 and 615 . After putting the deponent under oath or affirmation, the officer must record the testimony by the method designated under Rule 30(b)(3)(A). The testimony must be recorded by the officer personally or by a person acting in the presence and under the direction of the officer.


2. Objections. An objection at the time of the examination—whether to evidence, to a party's conduct, to the officer's qualifications, to the manner of taking the deposition, or to any other aspect of the deposition—must be noted on the record, but the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection. An objection must be stated concisely in a nonargumentative and nonsuggestive manner. A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present a motion under Rule 30(d)(3).


3. Participating Through Written Questions. Instead of participating in the oral examination, a party may serve written questions in a sealed envelope on the party noticing the deposition, who must deliver them to the officer. The officer must ask the deponent those questions and record the answers verbatim.


(d) Duration; Sanction; Motion to Terminate or Limit.


1. Duration. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a deposition is limited to 1 day of 7 hours. The court must allow additional time consistent with Rule 26(b)(1) and (2) if needed to fairly examine the deponent or if the deponent, another person, or any other circumstance impedes or delays the examination.


2. Sanction. The court may impose an appropriate sanction—including the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred by any party—on a person who impedes, delays, or frustrates the fair examination of the deponent.


3. Motion to Terminate or Limit.


    - (A) Grounds. At any time during a deposition, the deponent or a party may move to terminate or limit it on the ground that it is being conducted in bad faith or in a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party. The motion may be filed in the court where the action is pending or the deposition is being taken. If the objecting deponent or party so demands, the deposition must be suspended for the time necessary to obtain an order.


    - (B) Order. The court may order that the deposition be terminated or may limit its scope and manner as provided in Rule 26(c) . If terminated, the deposition may be resumed only by order of the court where the action is pending.


    - (C) Award of Expenses. Rule 37(a)(5) applies to the award of expenses.


(e) Review by the Witness; Changes.


1. Review; Statement of Changes. On request by the deponent or a party before the deposition is completed, the deponent must be allowed 30 days after being notified by the officer that the transcript or recording is available in which:


    - (A) to review the transcript or recording; and


    - (B) if there are changes in form or substance, to sign a statement listing the changes and the reasons for making them.


2. Changes Indicated in the Officer's Certificate. The officer must note in the certificate prescribed by Rule 30(f)(1) whether a review was requested and, if so, must attach any changes the deponent makes during the 30-day period.


(f) Certification and Delivery; Exhibits; Copies of the Transcript or Recording; Filing.


1. Certification and Delivery. The officer must certify in writing that the witness was duly sworn and that the deposition accurately records the witness's testimony. The certificate must accompany the record of the deposition. Unless the court orders otherwise, the officer must seal the deposition in an envelope or package bearing the title of the action and marked “Deposition of [witness's name]” and must promptly send it to the attorney who arranged for the transcript or recording. The attorney must store it under conditions that will protect it against loss, destruction, tampering, or deterioration.


2. Documents and Tangible Things.


    - (A) Originals and Copies. Documents and tangible things produced for inspection during a deposition must, on a party's request, be marked for identification and attached to the deposition. Any party may inspect and copy them. But if the person who produced them wants to keep the originals, the person may:


        - (i) offer copies to be marked, attached to the deposition, and then used as originals—after giving all parties a fair opportunity to verify the copies by comparing them with the originals; or


        - (ii) give all parties a fair opportunity to inspect and copy the originals after they are marked—in which event the originals may be used as if attached to the deposition.


    - (B) Order Regarding the Originals. Any party may move for an order that the originals be attached to the deposition pending final disposition of the case.


3. Copies of the Transcript or Recording. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, the officer must retain the stenographic notes of a deposition taken stenographically or a copy of the recording of a deposition taken by another method. When paid reasonable charges, the officer must furnish a copy of the transcript or recording to any party or the deponent.


4. Notice of Filing. A party who files the deposition must promptly notify all other parties of the filing.


(g) Failure to Attend a Deposition or Serve a Subpoena; Expenses. A party who, expecting a deposition to be taken, attends in person or by an attorney may recover reasonable expenses for attending, including attorney's fees, if the noticing party failed to:


1. attend and proceed with the deposition; or


2. serve a subpoena on a nonparty deponent, who consequently did not attend.
