(a) Entering a Plea.


1. In General. A defendant may plead not guilty, guilty, or (with the court's consent) nolo contendere.


2. Conditional Plea. With the consent of the court and the government, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere, reserving in writing the right to have an appellate court review an adverse determination of a specified pretrial motion. A defendant who prevails on appeal may then withdraw the plea.


3. Nolo Contendere Plea. Before accepting a plea of nolo contendere, the court must consider the parties’ views and the public interest in the effective administration of justice.


4. Failure to Enter a Plea. If a defendant refuses to enter a plea or if a defendant organization fails to appear, the court must enter a plea of not guilty.


(b) Considering and Accepting a Guilty or Nolo Contendere Plea.


1. Advising and Questioning the Defendant . Before the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the defendant may be placed under oath, and the court must address the defendant personally in open court. During this address, the court must inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands, the following:


    - (A) the government's right, in a prosecution for perjury or false statement, to use against the defendant any statement that the defendant gives under oath;


    - (B) the right to plead not guilty, or having already so pleaded, to persist in that plea;


    - (C) the right to a jury trial;


    - (D) the right to be represented by counsel—and if necessary have the court appoint counsel—at trial and at every other stage of the proceeding;


    - (E) the right at trial to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, to be protected from compelled self-incrimination, to testify and present evidence, and to compel the attendance of witnesses;


    - (F) the defendant's waiver of these trial rights if the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere;


    - (G) the nature of each charge to which the defendant is pleading;


    - (H) any maximum possible penalty, including imprisonment, fine, and term of supervised release;


    - (I) any mandatory minimum penalty;


    - (J) any applicable forfeiture;


    - (K) the court's authority to order restitution;


    - (L) the court's obligation to impose a special assessment;


    - (M) in determining a sentence, the court's obligation to calculate the applicable sentencing-guideline range and to consider that range, possible departures under the Sentencing Guidelines, and other sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. §3553(a) ;


    - (N) the terms of any plea-agreement provision waiving the right to appeal or to collaterally attack the sentence; and


    - (O) that, if convicted, a defendant who is not a United States citizen may be removed from the United States, denied citizenship, and denied admission to the United States in the future.


2. Ensuring That a Plea Is Voluntary. Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court must address the defendant personally in open court and determine that the plea is voluntary and did not result from force, threats, or promises (other than promises in a plea agreement).


3. Determining the Factual Basis for a Plea. Before entering judgment on a guilty plea, the court must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.


(c) Plea Agreement Procedure.


1. In General. An attorney for the government and the defendant's attorney, or the defendant when proceeding pro se, may discuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate in these discussions. If the defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere to either a charged offense or a lesser or related offense, the plea agreement may specify that an attorney for the government will:


    - (A) not bring, or will move to dismiss, other charges;


    - (B) recommend, or agree not to oppose the defendant's request, that a particular sentence or sentencing range is appropriate or that a particular provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, or policy statement, or sentencing factor does or does not apply (such a recommendation or request does not bind the court); or


    - (C) agree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case, or that a particular provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, or policy statement, or sentencing factor does or does not apply (such a recommendation or request binds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement).


2. Disclosing a Plea Agreement. The parties must disclose the plea agreement in open court when the plea is offered, unless the court for good cause allows the parties to disclose the plea agreement in camera.


3. Judicial Consideration of a Plea Agreement.


    - (A) To the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in Rule 11(c)(1)(A) or (C) , the court may accept the agreement, reject it, or defer a decision until the court has reviewed the presentence report.


    - (B) To the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in Rule 11(c)(1)(B) , the court must advise the defendant that the defendant has no right to withdraw the plea if the court does not follow the recommendation or request.


4. Accepting a Plea Agreement. If the court accepts the plea agreement, it must inform the defendant that to the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in Rule 11(c)(1)(A) or (C) , the agreed disposition will be included in the judgment.


5. Rejecting a Plea Agreement. If the court rejects a plea agreement containing provisions of the type specified in Rule 11(c)(1)(A) or (C) , the court must do the following on the record and in open court (or, for good cause, in camera):


    - (A) inform the parties that the court rejects the plea agreement;


    - (B) advise the defendant personally that the court is not required to follow the plea agreement and give the defendant an opportunity to withdraw the plea; and


    - (C) advise the defendant personally that if the plea is not withdrawn, the court may dispose of the case less favorably toward the defendant than the plea agreement contemplated.


(d) Withdrawing a Guilty or Nolo Contendere Plea. A defendant may withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendere:


1. before the court accepts the plea, for any reason or no reason; or


2. after the court accepts the plea, but before it imposes sentence if:


    - (A) the court rejects a plea agreement under 11(c)(5) ; or


    - (B) the defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.


(e) Finality of a Guilty or Nolo Contendere Plea. After the court imposes sentence, the defendant may not withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, and the plea may be set aside only on direct appeal or collateral attack.


(f) Admissibility or Inadmissibility of a Plea, Plea Discussions, and Related Statements. The admissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 410 .


(g) Recording the Proceedings. The proceedings during which the defendant enters a plea must be recorded by a court reporter or by a suitable recording device. If there is a guilty plea or a nolo contendere plea, the record must include the inquiries and advice to the defendant required under Rule 11(b) and (c) .


(h) Harmless Error. A variance from the requirements of this rule is harmless error if it does not affect substantial rights.
