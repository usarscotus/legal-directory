If a party to a case before the Supreme Court wishes to have legal representation in such a suit and wishes to appoint counsel who is not a member of the Bar of the Supreme Court, the Court may admit the attorney pro hac vice if it deems it necessary and appropriate.


A determination on behalf of the Court as provided under this Rule may be made by the Chief Justice, or by the Court itself with a majority of the Justices in favor.
