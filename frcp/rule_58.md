(a) Separate Document. Every judgment and amended judgment must be set out in a separate document, but a separate document is not required for an order disposing of a motion:


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) for judgment under Rule 50(b) ;


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to amend or make additional findings under Rule 52(b) ;


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) for attorney's fees under Rule 54 ;


&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) for a new trial, or to alter or amend the judgment, under Rule 59 ; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) for relief under Rule 60 .


(b) Entering Judgment.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Without the Court's Direction. Subject to Rule 54(b) and unless the court orders otherwise, the clerk must, without awaiting the court's direction, promptly prepare, sign, and enter the judgment when:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the jury returns a general verdict;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the court awards only costs or a sum certain; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) the court denies all relief.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Court's Approval Required. Subject to Rule 54(b) , the court must promptly approve the form of the judgment, which the clerk must promptly enter, when:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the jury returns a special verdict or a general verdict with answers to written questions; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the court grants other relief not described in this subdivision (b).


(c) Time of Entry. For purposes of these rules, judgment is entered at the following times:


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) if a separate document is not required, when the judgment is entered in the civil docket under Rule 79(a) ; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) if a separate document is required, when the judgment is entered in the civil docket under Rule 79(a) and the earlier of these events occurs:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) it is set out in a separate document; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) 150 days have run from the entry in the civil docket.


(d) Request for Entry. A party may request that judgment be set out in a separate document as required by Rule 58(a) .


(e) Cost or Fee Awards. Ordinarily, the entry of judgment may not be delayed, nor the time for appeal extended, in order to tax costs or award fees. But if a timely motion for attorney's fees is made under Rule 54(d)(2) , the court may act before a notice of appeal has been filed and become effective to order that the motion have the same effect under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4 (a)(4) as a timely motion under Rule 59 .
