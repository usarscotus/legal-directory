order: 407

When measures are taken that would have made an earlier injury or harm less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove:


* negligence;
* culpable conduct;
* a defect in a product or its design; or
* a need for a warning or instruction.


But the court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such as impeachment or — if disputed — proving ownership, control, or the feasibility of precautionary measures.
