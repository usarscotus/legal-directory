    - (A) may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact;


    - (B) must—for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter—rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing; and

    - (C) In Camera Proceedings . Upon a party's motion and for good cause, the court may hear in camera any statement made under Rule 32(i)(4) .


(j) Defendant's Right to Appeal.


1. Advice of a Right to Appeal.


    - (A) Appealing a Conviction . If the defendant pleaded not guilty and was convicted, after sentencing the court must advise the defendant of the right to appeal the conviction.

    - (C) Appeal Costs . The court must advise a defendant who is unable to pay appeal costs of the right to ask for permission to appeal in forma pauperis.


2. Clerk's Filing of Notice. If the defendant so requests, the clerk must immediately prepare and file a notice of appeal on the defendant's behalf.

1. In General. In the judgment of conviction, the court must set forth the plea, the jury verdict or the court's findings, the adjudication, and the sentence. If the defendant is found not guilty or is otherwise entitled to be discharged, the court must so order. The judge must sign the judgment, and the clerk must enter it.
