1. Proceedings in forma pauperis shall be considered the default for all filings before the Supreme Court of the United States, and no motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis shall be necessary.

2. Every document submitted to the Supreme Court shall be prepared in accordance with Rule 34 and this rule. Every document shall be legible. Every document shall be made in an attempt to replicate Supreme Court filings, if possible. While making due allowance for any case presented under this Rule by a person appearing pro se, the Clerk will not file any document if it does not comply with the substance of these Rules or is jurisdictionally out of time.

3. Whenever the Court appoints counsel for an indigent party in a case set for oral argument, the briefs on the merits submitted by that counsel, unless otherwise requested, shall be prepared under the Clerkâ€™s supervision.

4. In a case in which certiorari has been granted, probable jurisdiction noted, or consideration of jurisdiction postponed, this Court may appoint counsel to represent a party unable to obtain an attorney to the extent authorized by any applicable federal statute.
