These rules govern the procedure for obtaining a declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C. ยง2201 . Rules 38 and 39 govern a demand for a jury trial. The existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a declaratory judgment that is otherwise appropriate. The court may order a speedy hearing of a declaratory-judgment action.
