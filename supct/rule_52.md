Upon the submission of a petition for a writ of certiorari or any other petition before the Supreme Court, with exception for any emergency injuctions, the opposition party in the case shall have 72 hours to submit their brief of opposition before the Supreme Court can start the consideration of any petition before the Court.


Furthermore the Supreme Court, via the decision of the Chief Justice or any Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, may extend the 72 hours time limit to no more than 72 more hours if formally requested.


Any other Supreme Court Bar recipient may request to submit briefs if formally requested and approved by one of the Justices, with the same timeframe.
