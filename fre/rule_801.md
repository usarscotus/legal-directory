The following definitions apply under this article:


(a) Statement. “Statement” means a person’s oral assertion, written assertion, or nonverbal conduct, if the person intended it as an assertion.


(b) Declarant. “Declarant” means the person who made the statement.


(c) Hearsay. “Hearsay” means a statement that:


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.


(d) Statements That Are Not Hearsay. A statement that meets the following conditions is not hearsay:


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A Declarant-Witness’s Prior Statement. The declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination about a prior statement, and the statement:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) is inconsistent with the declarant’s testimony and was given under penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding or in a deposition;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) is consistent with the declarant’s testimony and is offered:


(i) to rebut an express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated it or acted from a recent improper influence or motive in so testifying; or


(ii) to rehabilitate the declarant’s credibility as a witness when attacked on another ground; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) identifies a person as someone the declarant perceived earlier.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) An Opposing Party’s Statement. The statement is offered against an opposing party and:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) was made by the party in an individual or representative capacity;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) is one the party manifested that it adopted or believed to be true;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) was made by a person whom the party authorized to make a statement on the subject;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) was made by the party’s agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) was made by the party’s coconspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.


The statement must be considered but does not by itself establish the declarant’s authority under (C); the existence or scope of the relationship under (D); or the existence of the conspiracy or participation in it under (E).
