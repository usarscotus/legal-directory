1. A brief on the merits for a petitioner or an appellant shall comply in all respects with Rules 33.1 and 34 and shall contain in the order here indicated:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The questions presented for review under Rule 14.1(a) . The questions shall be set out on the first page following the cover, and no other information may appear on that page. The phrasing of the questions presented need not be identical with that in the petition for a writ of certiorari or the jurisdictional statement, but the brief may not raise additional questions or change the substance of the questions already presented in those documents. At its option, however, the Court may consider a plain error not among the questions presented but evident from the record and otherwise within its jurisdiction to decide.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A list of all parties to the proceeding in the court whose judgment is under review (unless the caption of the case in this Court contains the names of all parties). Any amended list of parent companies and nonwholly owned subsidiaries as required by Rule 29.6 shall be placed here.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If the brief exceeds 1500 words, a table of contents and a table of cited authorities.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Citations of the official and unofficial reports of the opinions and orders entered in the case by courts and administrative agencies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) A concise statement of the basis for jurisdiction in this Court, including the statutory provisions and time factors on which jurisdiction rests.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The constitutional provisions, treaties, statutes, ordinances, and regulations involved in the case, set out verbatim with appropriate citation. If the provisions involved are lengthy, their citation alone suffices at this point, and their pertinent text, if not already set out in the petition for a writ of certiorari, jurisdictional statement, or an appendix to either document, shall be set out in an appendix to the brief.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) A concise statement of the case, setting out the facts material to the consideration of the questions presented, with appropriate references to the joint appendix, e. g. , App. 12, or to the record, e. g., Record 12.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) A summary of the argument, suitably paragraphed. The summary should be a clear and concise condensation of the argument made in the body of the brief; mere repetition of the headings under which the argument is arranged is not sufficient.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The argument, exhibiting clearly the points of fact and of law presented and citing the authorities and statutes relied on.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) A conclusion specifying with particularity the relief the party seeks.<br>
2. A brief on the merits for a respondent or an appellee shall conform to the foregoing requirements, except that items required by subparagraphs 1(a), (b), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this Rule need not be included unless the respondent or appellee is dissatisfied with their presentation by the opposing party.<br>
3. A brief on the merits may not exceed the word limitations specified in Rule 33.1(g) . An appendix to a brief may include only relevant material, and counsel are cautioned not to include in an appendix arguments or citations that properly belong in the body of the brief.<br>
4. A reply brief shall conform to those portions of this Rule applicable to the brief for a respondent or an appellee, but, if appropriately divided by topical headings, need not contain a summary of the argument.<br>
5. A reference to the joint appendix or to the record set out in any brief shall indicate the appropriate page number. If the reference is to an exhibit, the page numbers at which the exhibit appears, at which it was offered in evidence, and at which it was ruled on by the judge shall be indicated, e. g. , Pl. Exh. 14, Record 199, 2134.<br>
6. A brief shall be concise, logically arranged with proper headings, and free of irrelevant, immaterial, or scandalous matter. The Court may disregard or strike a brief that does not comply with this paragraph.<br>
