# Citation Graph React App

This directory contains a minimal React application that uses D3 to render
force-directed graphs of case citations.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set `VITE_API_URL` to the base URL of the Legal Directory API if it differs
from the default `http://localhost:8000`.
