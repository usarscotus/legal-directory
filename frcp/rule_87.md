---

(a) Conditions for an Emergency. The Judicial Conference of the United States may declare a Civil Rules emergency if it determines that extraordinary circumstances relating to public health or safety, or affecting physical or electronic access to a court, substantially impair the court's ability to perform its functions in compliance with these rules.


(b) Declaring an Emergency.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Content. The declaration:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) must designate the court or courts affected;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) adopts all the emergency rules in Rule 87(c) unless it excepts one or more of them; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) must be limited to a stated period of no more than 90 days.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Early Termination . The Judicial Conference may terminate a declaration for one or more courts before the termination date.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Additional Declarations . The Judicial Conference may issue additional declarations under this rule.


(c) Emergency Rules .


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Emergency Rules 4(e), (h)(1), (i), and (j)(2) and for serving a minor incompetent person. The court may by order authorize service on a defendant described in Rule 4(e), (h)(1), (i), or (j)(2)—or on a minor or incompetent person in a judicial district of the United States—by a method that is reasonably calculated to give notice. A method of service may be completed under the order after the declaration ends unless the court, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, modifies or rescinds the order.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Emergency Rule 6(b)(2).


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) Extension of Time to File Certain Motions . A court may, by order, apply Rule 6(b)(1)(A) to extend for a period of no more than 30 days after an entry of the order the time to act under Rules 50(b) and (d), 52(b), 59(b), (d), and (e), and 60(b).


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Effect on Time to Appeal . Unless the time to appeal would otherwise be longer:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) if the court denies an extension, the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the date the order denying the motion to extend is entered;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) if the court grants an extension, a motion authorized by the court and filed within the extended period is, for purposes of Appellate Rule 4(a)(4)(A), filed "within the time allowed by" the Federal Rules of Civil Procedre; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) if the court grants an extension and no motion authorized by the court is made within the extended period, the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the expiration of the extended period.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Declaration Ends . An act authorized by an order under this emergency rule may be completed under the order after the emergency declaration ends.


Rule A. Scope of Rules


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) These Supplemental Rules apply to:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the procedure in admiralty and maritime claims within the meaning of Rule 9(h) with respect to the following remedies:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) maritime attachment and garnishment,


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) actions in rem,


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) possessory, petitory, and partition actions, and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) actions for exoneration from or limitation of liability;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) forfeiture actions in rem arising from a federal statute; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) the procedure in statutory condemnation proceedings analogous to maritime actions in rem, whether within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction or not. Except as otherwise provided, references in these Supplemental Rules to actions in rem include such analogous statutory condemnation proceedings.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure also apply to the foregoing proceedings except to the extent that they are inconsistent with these Supplemental Rules.


Rule B. In Personam Actions: Attachment and Garnishment


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) When Available; Complaint, Affidavit, Judicial Authorization, and Process. In an in personam action:


(a) If a defendant is not found within the district when a verified complaint praying for attachment and the affidavit required by Rule B(1)(b) are filed, a verified complaint may contain a prayer for process to attach the defendant's tangible or intangible personal property—up to the amount sued for—in the hands of garnishees named in the process.


(b) The plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney must sign and file with the complaint an affidavit stating that, to the affiant's knowledge, or on information and belief, the defendant cannot be found within the district. The court must review the complaint and affidavit and, if the conditions of this Rule B appear to exist, enter an order so stating and authorizing process of attachment and garnishment. The clerk may issue supplemental process enforcing the court's order upon application without further court order.


(c) If the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney certifies that exigent circumstances make court review impracticable, the clerk must issue the summons and process of attachment and garnishment. The plaintiff has the burden in any post-attachment hearing under Rule E(4)(f) to show that exigent circumstances existed.


(d)(i) If the property is a vessel or tangible property on board a vessel, the summons, process, and any supplemental process must be delivered to the marshal for service.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) If the property is other tangible or intangible property, the summons, process, and any supplemental process must be delivered to a person or organization authorized to serve it, who may be (A) a marshal; (B) someone under contract with the United States; (C) someone specially appointed by the court for that purpose; or, (D) in an action brought by the United States, any officer or employee of the United States.


(e) The plaintiff may invoke state-law remedies under Rule 64 for seizure of person or property for the purpose of securing satisfaction of the judgment.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Notice to Defendant. No default judgment may be entered except upon proof—which may be by affidavit—that:


(a) the complaint, summons, and process of attachment or garnishment have been served on the defendant in a manner authorized by Rule 4 ;


(b) the plaintiff or the garnishee has mailed to the defendant the complaint, summons, and process of attachment or garnishment, using any form of mail requiring a return receipt; or


(c) the plaintiff or the garnishee has tried diligently to give notice of the action to the defendant but could not do so.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Answer.


(a) By Garnishee. The garnishee shall serve an answer, together with answers to any interrogatories served with the complaint, within 21 days after service of process upon the garnishee. Interrogatories to the garnishee may be served with the complaint without leave of court. If the garnishee refuses or neglects to answer on oath as to the debts, credits, or effects of the defendant in the garnishee's hands, or any interrogatories concerning such debts, credits, and effects that may be propounded by the plaintiff, the court may award compulsory process against the garnishee. If the garnishee admits any debts, credits, or effects, they shall be held in the garnishee's hands or paid into the registry of the court, and shall be held in either case subject to the further order of the court.


(b) By Defendant . The defendant shall serve an answer within 30 days after process has been executed, whether by attachment of property or service on the garnishee.


Rule C. In Rem Actions: Special Provisions


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) When Available. An action in rem may be brought:


(a) To enforce any maritime lien;


(b) Whenever a statute of the United States provides for a maritime action in rem or a proceeding analogous thereto.


Except as otherwise provided by law a party who may proceed in rem may also, or in the alternative, proceed in personam against any person who may be liable.


Statutory provisions exempting vessels or other property owned or possessed by or operated by or for the United States from arrest or seizure are not affected by this rule. When a statute so provides, an action against the United States or an instrumentality thereof may proceed on in rem principles.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Complaint. In an action in rem the complaint must:


(a) be verified;


(b) describe with reasonable particularity the property that is the subject of the action; and


(c) state that the property is within the district or will be within the district while the action is pending.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Judicial Authorization and Process.


(a) Arrest Warrant.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The court must review the complaint and any supporting papers. If the conditions for an in rem action appear to exist, the court must issue an order directing the clerk to issue a warrant for the arrest of the vessel or other property that is the subject of the action.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) If the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney certifies that exigent circumstances make court review impracticable, the clerk must promptly issue a summons and a warrant for the arrest of the vessel or other property that is the subject of the action. The plaintiff has the burden in any post-arrest hearing under Rule E(4)(f) to show that exigent circumstances existed.


(b) Service.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) If the property that is the subject of the action is a vessel or tangible property on board a vessel, the warrant and any supplemental process must be delivered to the marshal for service.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) If the property that is the subject of the action is other property, tangible or intangible, the warrant and any supplemental process must be delivered to a person or organization authorized to enforce it, who may be: (A) a marshal; (B) someone under contract with the United States; (C) someone specially appointed by the court for that purpose; or, (D) in an action brought by the United States, any officer or employee of the United States.


(c) Deposit in Court . If the property that is the subject of the action consists in whole or in part of freight, the proceeds of property sold, or other intangible property, the clerk must issue—in addition to the warrant—a summons directing any person controlling the property to show cause why it should not be deposited in court to abide the judgment.


(d) Supplemental Process . The clerk may upon application issue supplemental process to enforce the court's order without further court order.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Notice. No notice other than execution of process is required when the property that is the subject of the action has been released under Rule E(5). If the property is not released within 14 days after execution, the plaintiff must promptly—or within the time that the court allows—give public notice of the action and arrest in a newspaper designated by court order and having general circulation in the district, but publication may be terminated if the property is released before publication is completed. The notice must specify the time under Rule C(6) to file a statement of interest in or right against the seized property and to answer. This rule does not affect the notice requirements in an action to foreclose a preferred ship mortgage under 46 U.S.C. §§31301 et seq., as amended.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Ancillary Process. In any action in rem in which process has been served as provided by this rule, if any part of the property that is the subject of the action has not been brought within the control of the court because it has been removed or sold, or because it is intangible property in the hands of a person who has not been served with process, the court may, on motion, order any person having possession or control of such property or its proceeds to show cause why it should not be delivered into the custody of the marshal or other person or organization having a warrant for the arrest of the property, or paid into court to abide the judgment; and, after hearing, the court may enter such judgment as law and justice may require.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Responsive Pleading; Interrogatories.


(a) Statement of Interest; Answer. In an action in rem:


&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) a person who asserts a right of possession or any ownership interest in the property that is the subject of the action must file a verified statement of right or interest:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) within 14 days after the execution of process, or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) within the time that the court allows;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the statement of right or interest must describe the interest in the property that supports the person's demand for its restitution or right to defend the action;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) an agent, bailee, or attorney must state the authority to file a statement of right or interest on behalf of another; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) a person who asserts a right of possession or any ownership interest must serve an answer within 21 days after filing the statement of interest or right.


(b) Interrogatories . Interrogatories may be served with the complaint in an in rem action without leave of court. Answers to the interrogatories must be served with the answer to the complaint.


Rule D. Possessory, Petitory, and Partition Actions


In all actions for possession, partition, and to try title maintainable according to the course of the admiralty practice with respect to a vessel, in all actions so maintainable with respect to the possession of cargo or other maritime property, and in all actions by one or more part owners against the others to obtain security for the return of the vessel from any voyage undertaken without their consent, or by one or more part owners against the others to obtain possession of the vessel for any voyage on giving security for its safe return, the process shall be by a warrant of arrest of the vessel, cargo, or other property, and by notice in the manner provided by Rule B(2) to the adverse party or parties.


Rule E. Actions in Rem and Quasi in Rem: General Provisions


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Applicability. Except as otherwise provided, this rule applies to actions in personam with process of maritime attachment and garnishment, actions in rem, and petitory, possessory, and partition actions, supplementing Rules B, C, and D.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Complaint; Security.


(a) Complaint . In actions to which this rule is applicable the complaint shall state the circumstances from which the claim arises with such particularity that the defendant or claimant will be able, without moving for a more definite statement, to commence an investigation of the facts and to frame a responsive pleading.


(b) Security for Costs . Subject to the provisions of Rule 54(d) and of relevant statutes, the court may, on the filing of the complaint or on the appearance of any defendant, claimant, or any other party, or at any later time, require the plaintiff, defendant, claimant, or other party to give security, or additional security, in such sum as the court shall direct to pay all costs and expenses that shall be awarded against the party by any interlocutory order or by the final judgment, or on appeal by any appellate court.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Process.


(a) In admiralty and maritime proceedings process in rem or of maritime attachment and garnishment may be served only within the district.


(b) Issuance and Delivery . Issuance and delivery of process in rem, or of maritime attachment and garnishment, shall be held in abeyance if the plaintiff so requests.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Execution of Process; Marshal's Return; Custody of Property; Procedures for Release.


(a) In General . Upon issuance and delivery of the process, or, in the case of summons with process of attachment and garnishment, when it appears that the defendant cannot be found within the district, the marshal or other person or organization having a warrant shall forthwith execute the process in accordance with this subdivision (4), making due and prompt return.


(b) Tangible Property . If tangible property is to be attached or arrested, the marshal or other person or organization having the warrant shall take it into the marshal's possession for safe custody. If the character or situation of the property is such that the taking of actual possession is impracticable, the marshal or other person executing the process shall affix a copy thereof to the property in a conspicuous place and leave a copy of the complaint and process with the person having possession or the person's agent. In furtherance of the marshal's custody of any vessel the marshal is authorized to make a written request to the collector of customs not to grant clearance to such vessel until notified by the marshal or deputy marshal or by the clerk that the vessel has been released in accordance with these rules.


(c) Intangible Property . If intangible property is to be attached or arrested the marshal or other person or organization having the warrant shall execute the process by leaving with the garnishee or other obligor a copy of the complaint and process requiring the garnishee or other obligor to answer as provided in Rules B(3)(a) and C(6); or the marshal may accept for payment into the registry of the court the amount owed to the extent of the amount claimed by the plaintiff with interest and costs, in which event the garnishee or other obligor shall not be required to answer unless alias process shall be served.


(d) Directions With Respect to Property in Custody . The marshal or other person or organization having the warrant may at any time apply to the court for directions with respect to property that has been attached or arrested, and shall give notice of such application to any or all of the parties as the court may direct.


(e) Expenses of Seizing and Keeping Property; Deposit . These rules do not alter the provisions of Title 28, U.S.C., §1921, as amended, relative to the expenses of seizing and keeping property attached or arrested and to the requirement of deposits to cover such expenses.


(f) Procedure for Release From Arrest or Attachment . Whenever property is arrested or attached, any person claiming an interest in it shall be entitled to a prompt hearing at which the plaintiff shall be required to show why the arrest or attachment should not be vacated or other relief granted consistent with these rules. This subdivision shall have no application to suits for seamen's wages when process is issued upon a certification of sufficient cause filed pursuant to Title 46, U.S.C. §§603 and 604 1 or to actions by the United States for forfeitures for violation of any statute of the United States.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Release of Property.


(a) Special Bond . Whenever process of maritime attachment and garnishment or process in rem is issued the execution of such process shall be stayed, or the property released, on the giving of security, to be approved by the court or clerk, or by stipulation of the parties, conditioned to answer the judgment of the court or of any appellate court. The parties may stipulate the amount and nature of such security. In the event of the inability or refusal of the parties so to stipulate the court shall fix the principal sum of the bond or stipulation at an amount sufficient to cover the amount of the plaintiff's claim fairly stated with accrued interest and costs; but the principal sum shall in no event exceed (i) twice the amount of the plaintiff's claim or (ii) the value of the property on due appraisement, whichever is smaller. The bond or stipulation shall be conditioned for the payment of the principal sum and interest thereon at 6 per cent per annum.


(b) General Bond . The owner of any vessel may file a general bond or stipulation, with sufficient surety, to be approved by the court, conditioned to answer the judgment of such court in all or any actions that may be brought thereafter in such court in which the vessel is attached or arrested. Thereupon the execution of all such process against such vessel shall be stayed so long as the amount secured by such bond or stipulation is at least double the aggregate amount claimed by plaintiffs in all actions begun and pending in which such vessel has been attached or arrested. Judgments and remedies may be had on such bond or stipulation as if a special bond or stipulation had been filed in each of such actions. The district court may make necessary orders to carry this rule into effect, particularly as to the giving of proper notice of any action against or attachment of a vessel for which a general bond has been filed. Such bond or stipulation shall be indorsed by the clerk with a minute of the actions wherein process is so stayed. Further security may be required by the court at any time.


If a special bond or stipulation is given in a particular case, the liability on the general bond or stipulation shall cease as to that case.


(c) Release by Consent or Stipulation; Order of Court or Clerk; Costs . Any vessel, cargo, or other property in the custody of the marshal or other person or organization having the warrant may be released forthwith upon the marshal's acceptance and approval of a stipulation, bond, or other security, signed by the party on whose behalf the property is detained or the party's attorney and expressly authorizing such release, if all costs and charges of the court and its officers shall have first been paid. Otherwise no property in the custody of the marshal, other person or organization having the warrant, or other officer of the court shall be released without an order of the court; but such order may be entered as of course by the clerk, upon the giving of approved security as provided by law and these rules, or upon the dismissal or discontinuance of the action; but the marshal or other person or organization having the warrant shall not deliver any property so released until the costs and charges of the officers of the court shall first have been paid.


(d) Possessory, Petitory, and Partition Actions . The foregoing provisions of this subdivision (5) do not apply to petitory, possessory, and partition actions. In such cases the property arrested shall be released only by order of the court, on such terms and conditions and on the giving of such security as the court may require.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Reduction or Impairment of Security. Whenever security is taken the court may, on motion and hearing, for good cause shown, reduce the amount of security given; and if the surety shall be or become insufficient, new or additional sureties may be required on motion and hearing.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Security on Counterclaim.


(a) When a person who has given security for damages in the original action asserts a counterclaim that arises from the transaction or occurrence that is the subject of the original action, a plaintiff for whose benefit the security has been given must give security for damages demanded in the counterclaim unless the court, for cause shown, directs otherwise. Proceedings on the original claim must be stayed until this security is given, unless the court directs otherwise.


(b) The plaintiff is required to give security under Rule E(7)(a) when the United States or its corporate instrumentality counterclaims and would have been required to give security to respond in damages if a private party but is relieved by law from giving security.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Restricted Appearance. An appearance to defend against an admiralty and maritime claim with respect to which there has issued process in rem, or process of attachment and garnishment, may be expressly restricted to the defense of such claim, and in that event is not an appearance for the purposes of any other claim with respect to which such process is not available or has not been served.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Disposition of Property; Sales.


(a) Interlocutory Sales; Delivery.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) On application of a party, the marshal, or other person having custody of the property, the court may order all or part of the property sold—with the sales proceeds, or as much of them as will satisfy the judgment, paid into court to await further orders of the court—if:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the attached or arrested property is perishable, or liable to deterioration, decay, or injury by being detained in custody pending the action;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the expense of keeping the property is excessive or disproportionate; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) there is an unreasonable delay in securing release of the property.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) In the circumstances described in Rule E(9)(a)(i), the court, on motion by a defendant or a person filing a statement of interest or right under Rule C(6), may order that the property, rather than being sold, be delivered to the movant upon giving security under these rules.


(b) Sales, Proceeds . All sales of property shall be made by the marshal or a deputy marshal, or by other person or organization having the warrant, or by any other person assigned by the court where the marshal or other person or organization having the warrant is a party in interest; and the proceeds of sale shall be forthwith paid into the registry of the court to be disposed of according to law.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Preservation of Property. When the owner or another person remains in possession of property attached or arrested under the provisions of Rule E(4)(b) that permit execution of process without taking actual possession, the court, on a party's motion or on its own, may enter any order necessary to preserve the property and to prevent its removal.


Rule F. Limitation of Liability


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Time for Filing Complaint; Security. Not later than six months after receipt of a claim in writing, any vessel owner may file a complaint in the appropriate district court, as provided in subdivision (9) of this rule, for limitation of liability pursuant to statute. The owner (a) shall deposit with the court, for the benefit of claimants, a sum equal to the amount or value of the owner's interest in the vessel and pending freight, or approved security therefor, and in addition such sums, or approved security therefor, as the court may from time to time fix as necessary to carry out the provisions of the statutes as amended; or (b) at the owner's option shall transfer to a trustee to be appointed by the court, for the benefit of claimants, the owner's interest in the vessel and pending freight, together with such sums, or approved security therefor, as the court may from time to time fix as necessary to carry out the provisions of the statutes as amended. The plaintiff shall also give security for costs and, if the plaintiff elects to give security, for interest at the rate of 6 percent per annum from the date of the security.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Complaint. The complaint shall set forth the facts on the basis of which the right to limit liability is asserted and all facts necessary to enable the court to determine the amount to which the owner's liability shall be limited. The complaint may demand exoneration from as well as limitation of liability. It shall state the voyage if any, on which the demands sought to be limited arose, with the date and place of its termination; the amount of all demands including all unsatisfied liens or claims of lien, in contract or in tort or otherwise, arising on that voyage, so far as known to the plaintiff, and what actions and proceedings, if any, are pending thereon; whether the vessel was damaged, lost, or abandoned, and, if so, when and where; the value of the vessel at the close of the voyage or, in case of wreck, the value of her wreckage, strippings, or proceeds, if any, and where and in whose possession they are; and the amount of any pending freight recovered or recoverable. If the plaintiff elects to transfer the plaintiff's interest in the vessel to a trustee, the complaint must further show any prior paramount liens thereon, and what voyages or trips, if any, she has made since the voyage or trip on which the claims sought to be limited arose, and any existing liens arising upon any such subsequent voyage or trip, with the amounts and causes thereof, and the names and addresses of the lienors, so far as known; and whether the vessel sustained any injury upon or by reason of such subsequent voyage or trip.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Claims Against Owner; Injunction. Upon compliance by the owner with the requirements of subdivision (1) of this rule all claims and proceedings against the owner or the owner's property with respect to the matter in question shall cease. On application of the plaintiff the court shall enjoin the further prosecution of any action or proceeding against the plaintiff or the plaintiff's property with respect to any claim subject to limitation in the action.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Notice to Claimants. Upon the owner's compliance with subdivision (1) of this rule the court shall issue a notice to all persons asserting claims with respect to which the complaint seeks limitation, admonishing them to file their respective claims with the clerk of the court and to serve on the attorneys for the plaintiff a copy thereof on or before a date to be named in the notice. The date so fixed shall not be less than 30 days after issuance of the notice. For cause shown, the court may enlarge the time within which claims may be filed. The notice shall be published in such newspaper or newspapers as the court may direct once a week for four successive weeks prior to the date fixed for the filing of claims. The plaintiff not later than the day of second publication shall also mail a copy of the notice to every person known to have made any claim against the vessel or the plaintiff arising out of the voyage or trip on which the claims sought to be limited arose. In cases involving death a copy of such notice shall be mailed to the decedent at the decedent's last known address, and also to any person who shall be known to have made any claim on account of such death.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Claims and Answer. Claims shall be filed and served on or before the date specified in the notice provided for in subdivision (4) of this rule. Each claim shall specify the facts upon which the claimant relies in support of the claim, the items thereof, and the dates on which the same accrued. If a claimant desires to contest either the right to exoneration from or the right to limitation of liability the claimant shall file and serve an answer to the complaint unless the claim has included an answer.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Information To Be Given Claimants. Within 30 days after the date specified in the notice for filing claims, or within such time as the court thereafter may allow, the plaintiff shall mail to the attorney for each claimant (or if the claimant has no attorney to the claimant) a list setting forth (a) the name of each claimant, (b) the name and address of the claimant's attorney (if the claimant is known to have one), (c) the nature of the claim, i.e., whether property loss, property damage, death, personal injury etc., and (d) the amount thereof.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Insufficiency of Fund or Security. Any claimant may by motion demand that the funds deposited in court or the security given by the plaintiff be increased on the ground that they are less than the value of the plaintiff's interest in the vessel and pending freight. Thereupon the court shall cause due appraisement to be made of the value of the plaintiff's interest in the vessel and pending freight; and if the court finds that the deposit or security is either insufficient or excessive it shall order its increase or reduction. In like manner any claimant may demand that the deposit or security be increased on the ground that it is insufficient to carry out the provisions of the statutes relating to claims in respect of loss of life or bodily injury; and, after notice and hearing, the court may similarly order that the deposit or security be increased or reduced.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Objections to Claims: Distribution of Fund. Any interested party may question or controvert any claim without filing an objection thereto. Upon determination of liability the fund deposited or secured, or the proceeds of the vessel and pending freight, shall be divided pro rata, subject to all relevant provisions of law, among the several claimants in proportion to the amounts of their respective claims, duly proved, saving, however, to all parties any priority to which they may be legally entitled.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Venue; Transfer. The complaint shall be filed in any district in which the vessel has been attached or arrested to answer for any claim with respect to which the plaintiff seeks to limit liability; or, if the vessel has not been attached or arrested, then in any district in which the owner has been sued with respect to any such claim. When the vessel has not been attached or arrested to answer the matters aforesaid, and suit has not been commenced against the owner, the proceedings may be had in the district in which the vessel may be, but if the vessel is not within any district and no suit has been commenced in any district, then the complaint may be filed in any district. For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, the court may transfer the action to any district; if venue is wrongly laid the court shall dismiss or, if it be in the interest of justice, transfer the action to any district in which it could have been brought. If the vessel shall have been sold, the proceeds shall represent the vessel for the purposes of these rules.


Rule G. Forfeiture Actions in Rem


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Scope. This rule governs a forfeiture action in rem arising from a federal statute. To the extent that this rule does not address an issue, Supplemental Rules C and E and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure also apply.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Complaint. The complaint must:


(a) be verified;


(b) state the grounds for subject-matter jurisdiction, in rem jurisdiction over the defendant property, and venue;


(c) describe the property with reasonable particularity;


(d) if the property is tangible, state its location when any seizure occurred and—if different—its location when the action is filed;


(e) identify the statute under which the forfeiture action is brought; and


(f) state sufficiently detailed facts to support a reasonable belief that the government will be able to meet its burden of proof at trial.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Judicial Authorization and Process.


(a) Real Property . If the defendant is real property, the government must proceed under 18 U.S.C. §985 .


(b) Other Property; Arrest Warrant . If the defendant is not real property:


&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the clerk must issue a warrant to arrest the property if it is in the government's possession, custody, or control;


&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the court—on finding probable cause—must issue a warrant to arrest the property if it is not in the government's possession, custody, or control and is not subject to a judicial restraining order; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) a warrant is not necessary if the property is subject to a judicial restraining order.


(c) Execution of Process.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The warrant and any supplemental process must be delivered to a person or organization authorized to execute it, who may be: (A) a marshal or any other United States officer or employee; (B) someone under contract with the United States; or (C) someone specially appointed by the court for that purpose.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The authorized person or organization must execute the warrant and any supplemental process on property in the United States as soon as practicable unless:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the property is in the government's possession, custody, or control; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the court orders a different time when the complaint is under seal, the action is stayed before the warrant and supplemental process are executed, or the court finds other good cause.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The warrant and any supplemental process may be executed within the district or, when authorized by statute, outside the district.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) If executing a warrant on property outside the United States is required, the warrant may be transmitted to an appropriate authority for serving process where the property is located.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Notice.


(a) Notice by Publication.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) When Publication Is Required . A judgment of forfeiture may be entered only if the government has published notice of the action within a reasonable time after filing the complaint or at a time the court orders. But notice need not be published if:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the defendant property is worth less than $1,000 and direct notice is sent under Rule G(4)(b) to every person the government can reasonably identify as a potential claimant; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the court finds that the cost of publication exceeds the property's value and that other means of notice would satisfy due process.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Content of the Notice . Unless the court orders otherwise, the notice must:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) describe the property with reasonable particularity;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) state the times under Rule G(5) to file a claim and to answer; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) name the government attorney to be served with the claim and answer.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Frequency of Publication . Published notice must appear:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) once a week for three consecutive weeks; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) only once if, before the action was filed, notice of nonjudicial forfeiture of the same property was published on an official internet government forfeiture site for at least 30 consecutive days, or in a newspaper of general circulation for three consecutive weeks in a district where publication is authorized under Rule G(4)(a)(iv).


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Means of Publication . The government should select from the following options a means of publication reasonably calculated to notify potential claimants of the action:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) if the property is in the United States, publication in a newspaper generally circulated in the district where the action is filed, where the property was seized, or where property that was not seized is located;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) if the property is outside the United States, publication in a newspaper generally circulated in a district where the action is filed, in a newspaper generally circulated in the country where the property is located, or in legal notices published and generally circulated in the country where the property is located; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) instead of (A) or (B), posting a notice on an official internet government forfeiture site for at least 30 consecutive days.


(b) Notice to Known Potential Claimants.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Direct Notice Required . The government must send notice of the action and a copy of the complaint to any person who reasonably appears to be a potential claimant on the facts known to the government before the end of the time for filing a claim under Rule G(5)(a)(ii)(B).


&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Content of the Notice . The notice must state:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the date when the notice is sent;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) a deadline for filing a claim, at least 35 days after the notice is sent;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) that an answer or a motion under Rule 12 must be filed no later than 21 days after filing the claim; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) the name of the government attorney to be served with the claim and answer.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Sending Notice.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) The notice must be sent by means reasonably calculated to reach the potential claimant.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Notice may be sent to the potential claimant or to the attorney representing the potential claimant with respect to the seizure of the property or in a related investigation, administrative forfeiture proceeding, or criminal case.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Notice sent to a potential claimant who is incarcerated must be sent to the place of incarceration.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) Notice to a person arrested in connection with an offense giving rise to the forfeiture who is not incarcerated when notice is sent may be sent to the address that person last gave to the agency that arrested or released the person.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) Notice to a person from whom the property was seized who is not incarcerated when notice is sent may be sent to the last address that person gave to the agency that seized the property.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) When Notice Is Sent . Notice by the following means is sent on the date when it is placed in the mail, delivered to a commercial carrier, or sent by electronic mail.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Actual Notice . A potential claimant who had actual notice of a forfeiture action may not oppose or seek relief from forfeiture because of the government's failure to send the required notice.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Responsive Pleadings.


(a) Filing a Claim.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) A person who asserts an interest in the defendant property may contest the forfeiture by filing a claim in the court where the action is pending. The claim must:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) identify the specific property claimed;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) identify the claimant and state the claimant's interest in the property;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) be signed by the claimant under penalty of perjury; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) be served on the government attorney designated under Rule G(4)(a)(ii)(C) or (b)(ii)(D).


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Unless the court for good cause sets a different time, the claim must be filed:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) by the time stated in a direct notice sent under Rule G(4)(b);


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) if notice was published but direct notice was not sent to the claimant or the claimant's attorney, no later than 30 days after final publication of newspaper notice or legal notice under Rule G(4)(a) or no later than 60 days after the first day of publication on an official internet government forfeiture site; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) if notice was not published and direct notice was not sent to the claimant or the claimant's attorney:


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) if the property was in the government's possession, custody, or control when the complaint was filed, no later than 60 days after the filing, not counting any time when the complaint was under seal or when the action was stayed before execution of a warrant issued under Rule G(3)(b); or


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) if the property was not in the government's possession, custody, or control when the complaint was filed, no later than 60 days after the government complied with 18 U.S.C. §985(c) as to real property, or 60 days after process was executed on the property under Rule G(3).


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) A claim filed by a person asserting an interest as a bailee must identify the bailor, and if filed on the bailor's behalf must state the authority to do so.


(b) Answer . A claimant must serve and file an answer to the complaint or a motion under Rule 12 within 21 days after filing the claim. A claimant waives an objection to in rem jurisdiction or to venue if the objection is not made by motion or stated in the answer.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Special Interrogatories.


(a) Time and Scope . The government may serve special interrogatories limited to the claimant's identity and relationship to the defendant property without the court's leave at any time after the claim is filed and before discovery is closed. But if the claimant serves a motion to dismiss the action, the government must serve the interrogatories within 21 days after the motion is served.


(b) Answers or Objections . Answers or objections to these interrogatories must be served within 21 days after the interrogatories are served.


(c) Government's Response Deferred . The government need not respond to a claimant's motion to dismiss the action under Rule G(8)(b) until 21 days after the claimant has answered these interrogatories.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Preserving, Preventing Criminal Use, and Disposing of Property; Sales.


(a) Preserving and Preventing Criminal Use of Property . When the government does not have actual possession of the defendant property the court, on motion or on its own, may enter any order necessary to preserve the property, to prevent its removal or encumbrance, or to prevent its use in a criminal offense.


(b) Interlocutory Sale or Delivery.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Order to Sell . On motion by a party or a person having custody of the property, the court may order all or part of the property sold if:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the property is perishable or at risk of deterioration, decay, or injury by being detained in custody pending the action;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the expense of keeping the property is excessive or is disproportionate to its fair market value;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) the property is subject to a mortgage or to taxes on which the owner is in default; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) the court finds other good cause.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Who Makes the Sale . A sale must be made by a United States agency that has authority to sell the property, by the agency's contractor, or by any person the court designates.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Sale Procedures . The sale is governed by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2001 , 2002 , and 2004 , unless all parties, with the court's approval, agree to the sale, aspects of the sale, or different procedures.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Sale Proceeds . Sale proceeds are a substitute res subject to forfeiture in place of the property that was sold. The proceeds must be held in an interest-bearing account maintained by the United States pending the conclusion of the forfeiture action.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Delivery on a Claimant's Motion . The court may order that the property be delivered to the claimant pending the conclusion of the action if the claimant shows circumstances that would permit sale under Rule G(7)(b)(i) and gives security under these rules.


(c) Disposing of Forfeited Property . Upon entry of a forfeiture judgment, the property or proceeds from selling the property must be disposed of as provided by law.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Motions.


(a) Motion To Suppress Use of the Property as Evidence . If the defendant property was seized, a party with standing to contest the lawfulness of the seizure may move to suppress use of the property as evidence. Suppression does not affect forfeiture of the property based on independently derived evidence.


(b) Motion To Dismiss the Action.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) A claimant who establishes standing to contest forfeiture may move to dismiss the action under Rule 12(b) .


&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) In an action governed by 18 U.S.C. §983(a)(3)(D) the complaint may not be dismissed on the ground that the government did not have adequate evidence at the time the complaint was filed to establish the forfeitability of the property. The sufficiency of the complaint is governed by Rule G(2).


(c) Motion To Strike a Claim or Answer.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) At any time before trial, the government may move to strike a claim or answer:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) for failing to comply with Rule G(5) or (6), or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) because the claimant lacks standing.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The motion:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) must be decided before any motion by the claimant to dismiss the action; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) may be presented as a motion for judgment on the pleadings or as a motion to determine after a hearing or by summary judgment whether the claimant can carry the burden of establishing standing by a preponderance of the evidence.


(d) Petition To Release Property.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) If a United States agency or an agency's contractor holds property for judicial or nonjudicial forfeiture under a statute governed by 18 U.S.C. §983(f) , a person who has filed a claim to the property may petition for its release under §983(f).


&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) If a petition for release is filed before a judicial forfeiture action is filed against the property, the petition may be filed either in the district where the property was seized or in the district where a warrant to seize the property issued. If a judicial forfeiture action against the property is later filed in another district—or if the government shows that the action will be filed in another district—the petition may be transferred to that district under 28 U.S.C. §1404 .


(e) Excessive Fines . A claimant may seek to mitigate a forfeiture under the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment by motion for summary judgment or by motion made after entry of a forfeiture judgment if:


&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the claimant has pleaded the defense under Rule 8 ; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the parties have had the opportunity to conduct civil discovery on the defense.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Trial. Trial is to the court unless any party demands trial by jury under Rule 38 .
