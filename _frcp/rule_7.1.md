(a) Who Must File; Contents.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Nongovernmental Corporations. A nongovernmental corporate party or a nongovernmental corporation that seeks to intervene must file a statement that:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) identifies any parent corporation and any publicly held corporation owning 10% or more of its stock; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) states that there is no such corporation.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Parties or Intervenors in a Diversity Case.


In an action in which jurisdiction is based on diversity under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a), a party or intervenor must, unless the court orders otherwise, file a disclosure statement. The statement must name—and identify the citizenship of—every individual or entity whose citizenship is attributed to that party or intervenor:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) when the action is filed in or removed to federal court, and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) when any later event occurs that could affect the court’s jurisdiction under § 1332(a).


(b) Time to File; Supplemental Filing.


A party, intervenor, or proposed intervenor must:


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) file the disclosure statement with its first appearance, pleading, petition, motion, response, or other request addressed to the court; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) promptly file a supplemental statement if any required information changes.
