(a) Capacity or Authority to Sue; Legal Existence.


1. In General. Except when required to show that the court has jurisdiction, a pleading need not allege:


    - (A) a party's capacity to sue or be sued;


    - (B) a party's authority to sue or be sued in a representative capacity; or


    - (C) the legal existence of an organized association of persons that is made a party.


2. Raising Those Issues. To raise any of those issues, a party must do so by a specific denial, which must state any supporting facts that are peculiarly within the party's knowledge.


(b) Fraud or Mistake; Conditions of Mind. In alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally.


(c) Conditions Precedent. In pleading conditions precedent, it suffices to allege generally that all conditions precedent have occurred or been performed. But when denying that a condition precedent has occurred or been performed, a party must do so with particularity.


(d) Official Document or Act. In pleading an official document or official act, it suffices to allege that the document was legally issued or the act legally done.


(e) Judgment. In pleading a judgment or decision of a domestic or foreign court, a judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal, or a board or officer, it suffices to plead the judgment or decision without showing jurisdiction to render it.


(f) Time and Place. An allegation of time or place is material when testing the sufficiency of a pleading.


(g) Special Damages. If an item of special damage is claimed, it must be specifically stated.


(h) Admiralty or Maritime Claim.


1. How Designated. If a claim for relief is within the admiralty or maritime jurisdiction and also within the court's subject-matter jurisdiction on some other ground, the pleading may designate the claim as an admiralty or maritime claim for purposes of Rules 14(c) , 38(e) , and 82 and the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions . A claim cognizable only in the admiralty or maritime jurisdiction is an admiralty or maritime claim for those purposes, whether or not so designated.


2. Designation for Appeal. A case that includes an admiralty or maritime claim within this subdivision (h) is an admiralty case within 28 U.S.C. ยง1292(a)(3) .
