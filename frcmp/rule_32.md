(e) Disclosing the Report and Recommendation.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Time to Disclose. Unless the defendant has consented in writing, the probation officer must not submit a presentence report to the court or disclose its contents to anyone until the defendant has pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, or has been found guilty.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Minimum Required Notice. The probation officer must give the presentence report to the defendant, the defendant's attorney, and an attorney for the government at least 35 days before sentencing unless the defendant waives this minimum period.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Sentence Recommendation. By local rule or by order in a case, the court may direct the probation officer not to disclose to anyone other than the court the officer's recommendation on the sentence.


(f) Objecting to the Report.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Time to Object. Within 14 days after receiving the presentence report, the parties must state in writing any objections, including objections to material information, sentencing guideline ranges, and policy statements contained in or omitted from the report.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Serving Objections. An objecting party must provide a copy of its objections to the opposing party and to the probation officer.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Action on Objections. After receiving objections, the probation officer may meet with the parties to discuss the objections. The probation officer may then investigate further and revise the presentence report as appropriate.


(g) Submitting the Report. At least 7 days before sentencing, the probation officer must submit to the court and to the parties the presentence report and an addendum containing any unresolved objections, the grounds for those objections, and the probation officer's comments on them.


(h) Notice of Possible Departure from Sentencing Guidelines. Before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party's prehearing submission, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure. The notice must specify any ground on which the court is contemplating a departure.


(i) Sentencing.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In General. At sentencing, the court:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) must verify that the defendant and the defendant's attorney have read and discussed the presentence report and any addendum to the report;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) must give to the defendant and an attorney for the government a written summary of—or summarize in camera—any information excluded from the presentence report under Rule 32(d)(3) on which the court will rely in sentencing, and give them a reasonable opportunity to comment on that information;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) must allow the parties’ attorneys to comment on the probation officer's determinations and other matters relating to an appropriate sentence; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) may, for good cause, allow a party to make a new objection at any time before sentence is imposed.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Introducing Evidence; Producing a Statement. The court may permit the parties to introduce evidence on the objections. If a witness testifies at sentencing, Rule 26.2(a) –(d) and (f) applies. If a party fails to comply with a Rule 26.2 order to produce a witness's statement, the court must not consider that witness's testimony.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Court Determinations. At sentencing, the court:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) must—for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter—rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) must append a copy of the court's determinations under this rule to any copy of the presentence report made available to the Bureau of Prisons.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Opportunity to Speak.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) By a Party. Before imposing sentence, the court must:


(i) provide the defendant's attorney an opportunity to speak on the defendant's behalf;


&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) provide an attorney for the government an opportunity to speak equivalent to that of the defendant's attorney.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) By a Victim. Before imposing sentence, the court must address any victim of the crime who is present at sentencing and must permit the victim to be reasonably heard.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) In Camera Proceedings . Upon a party's motion and for good cause, the court may hear in camera any statement made under Rule 32(i)(4) .


(j) Defendant's Right to Appeal.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Advice of a Right to Appeal.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) Appealing a Conviction . If the defendant pleaded not guilty and was convicted, after sentencing the court must advise the defendant of the right to appeal the conviction.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Appealing a Sentence . After sentencing—regardless of the defendant's plea—the court must advise the defendant of any right to appeal the sentence.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Appeal Costs . The court must advise a defendant who is unable to pay appeal costs of the right to ask for permission to appeal in forma pauperis.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Clerk's Filing of Notice. If the defendant so requests, the clerk must immediately prepare and file a notice of appeal on the defendant's behalf.


(k) Judgment.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In General. In the judgment of conviction, the court must set forth the plea, the jury verdict or the court's findings, the adjudication, and the sentence. If the defendant is found not guilty or is otherwise entitled to be discharged, the court must so order. The judge must sign the judgment, and the clerk must enter it.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Criminal Forfeiture. Forfeiture procedures are governed by Rule 32.2 .
