1. Any Justice may appoint an individual to the Bar of the Court without motion through ordinary admission.


2. Privileges of the Bar shall extend to practice in all lower Courts of the United States and the ability to provide representation in cases before the Supreme Court and to permit the filing of amicus briefs where permitted.


3. Any individual that is temporarily banned by an Administrator or a Group Management member shall be stripped of the Supreme Court Bar automatically and shall be barred from holding the Supreme Court Bar for seven (7) days, starting at the moment his temporary ban has expired.


4. If a majority of Justices deem it sufficient that a member of the Supreme Court Bar be removed for gross misconduct or any action that brings disrepute onto himself, that member shall be removed via majority vote of the Justices.
