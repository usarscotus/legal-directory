1. These Rules, adopted September 27, 2017, will be effecÂ­tive November 13, 2017.


2. The Rules govern all proceedings after their effective date except that the amendments to Rules 25.3 and 33.1(g) will apply only to cases in which certiorari was granted, or a direct appeal or original action was set for argument, after the effective date.


3. In any case in which a petitioner or appellant has filed its brief on the merits prior to the effective date of these revised Rules, all remaining briefs in that case may comply with the October 1, 2007, version of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States rather than with these revised Rules.
