(a) Motion for a Stay.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Initial Motion Before the Agency. A petitioner must ordinarily move first before the agency for a stay pending review of its decision or order.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Motion in the Court of Appeals. A motion for a stay may be made to the court of appeals or one of its judges.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) The motion must:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) show that moving first before the agency would be impracticable; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) state that, a motion having been made, the agency denied the motion or failed to afford the relief requested and state any reasons given by the agency for its action.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) The motion must also include:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the reasons for granting the relief requested and the facts relied on;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) originals or copies of affidavits or other sworn statements supporting facts subject to dispute; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) relevant parts of the record.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) The moving party must give reasonable notice of the motion to all parties.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) The motion must be filed with the circuit clerk and normally will be considered by a panel of the court. But in an exceptional case in which time requirements make that procedure impracticable, the motion may be made to and considered by a single judge.


(b) Bond. The court may condition relief on the filing of a bond or other appropriate security.
