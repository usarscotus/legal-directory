    - "Rule 12(4) and (5) [Amended](https://trello.com/c/YKWP05iL/20-filing-deadlines-for-briefs) on July 12th, 2025."
---

1. The petitioner shall file a writ of certiorari in accordance with these rules.


2. The petition shall comply in all respects with Rule 14 and other rules. The case then will be placed on the docket. It is the petitioner’s duty to notify all respondents promptly, on a form supplied by the Clerk, of the date of filing, the date the case was placed on the docket, and the docket number of the case. The notice shall be served as required by Rule 29.


3. Parties interested jointly, severally, or otherwise in a judgment may petition separately for a writ of certiorari; or any two or more may join in a petition. A party not shown on the petition as joined therein at the time the petition is filed may not later join in that petition. When two or more judgments are sought to be reviewed on a writ of certiorari to the same court and involve identical or closely related questions, a single petition for a writ of certiorari covering all the judgments suffices. A petition for a writ of certiorari may not be joined with any other pleading.


4. No more than 72 hours after a case has been placed on the docket, a respondent seeking to file a conditional cross petition (i. e., a cross-petition that otherwise would be untimely) shall file, with proof of service as required by Rule 29, a copy of the cross-petition prepared in accordance with with Rule 12.2. The cross-petition shall comply in all respects with this Rule and Rule 14 , except that material already reproduced in the appendix to the opening petition need not be reproduced again. The cover of the cross-petition shall indicate clearly that it is a conditional cross petition. The cross petition then will be placed on the docket, subject to the provisions of Rule 13.4. It is the cross-petitioner’s duty to notify all cross respondents promptly, on a form supplied by the Clerk, of the date of filing, the date the cross-petition was placed on the docket, and the docket number of the cross petition. The notice shall be served as required by Rule 29. A cross petition for a writ of certiorari may not be joined with any other pleading. The time to file a cross petition will not be extended.


5. All parties to the proceeding in the court whose judgment is sought to be reviewed are deemed parties entitled to file documents in this Court, unless the petitioner notifies the Clerk of this Court in writing of the petitioner’s belief that one or more of the parties below have no interest in the outcome of the petition. A copy of such notice shall be served as required by Rule 29 on all parties to the proceeding below. A party noted as no longer interested may remain a party by notifying the Clerk promptly, with service on the other parties, of an intention to remain a party. All parties other than the petitioner are considered respondents, but any respondent who supports the position of a petitioner shall meet the petitioner’s time schedule for filing documents, with the following exception: A response of a party aligned with petitioner below who supports granting the petition shall be filed within 72 hours after the case is placed on the docket, and that time will not be extended. Counsel for such respondent shall ensure that counsel of record for all parties receive notice of its intention to file a brief in support within 72 hours after the case is placed on the docket. A respondent not aligned with petitioner below who supports granting the petition, or a respondent aligned with petitioner below who takes the position that the petition should be denied, is not subject to the notice requirement and may file a response within the time otherwise provided by Rule 15.3. Parties who file no document will not qualify for any relief from this Court.


6. The clerk of the court having possession of the record shall keep it until notified by the Clerk of this Court to certify and transmit it. In any document filed with this Court, a party may cite or quote from the record, even if it has not been transmitted to this Court. When requested by the Clerk of this Court to certify and transmit the record, or any part of it, the clerk of the court having possession of the record shall number the documents to be certified and shall transmit therewith a numbered list specifically identifying each document transmitted. If the record, or stipulated portions, have been printed for the use of the court below, that printed record, plus the proceedings in the court below, may be certified as the record unless one of the parties or the Clerk of this Court requests otherwise. The record may consist of certified copies, but if the lower court is of the view that original documents of any kind should be seen by this Court, that court may provide by order for the transport, safekeeping, and return of such originals.
