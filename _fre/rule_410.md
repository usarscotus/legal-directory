(a) Prohibited Uses. In a civil or criminal case, evidence of the following is not admissible against the defendant who made the plea or participated in the plea discussions:


1. a guilty plea that was later withdrawn;


2. a nolo contendere plea;


3. a statement made during a proceeding on either of those pleas under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 or a comparable state procedure; or


4. a statement made during plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority if the discussions did not result in a guilty plea or they resulted in a later-withdrawn guilty plea.


(b) Exceptions. The court may admit a statement described in Rule 410(a)(3) or (4):


1. in any proceeding in which another statement made during the same plea or plea discussions has been introduced, if in fairness the statements ought to be considered together; or


2. in a criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement, if the defendant made the statement under oath, on the record, and with counsel present.
