(a) Character Evidence.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Prohibited Uses. Evidence of a person’s character or character trait is not admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character or trait.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Exceptions for a Defendant or Victim in a Criminal Case. The following exceptions apply in a criminal case:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) a defendant may offer evidence of the defendant’s pertinent trait, and if the evidence is admitted, the prosecutor may offer evidence to rebut it;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) subject to the limitations in Rule 412, a defendant may offer evidence of an alleged victim’s pertinent trait, and if the evidence is admitted, the prosecutor may:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) offer evidence to rebut it; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) offer evidence of the defendant’s same trait; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) in a homicide case, the prosecutor may offer evidence of the alleged victim’s trait of peacefulness to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Exceptions for a Witness. Evidence of a witness’s character may be admitted under Rules 607, 608, and 609.


(b) Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Prohibited Uses. Evidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is not admissible to prove a person’s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Permitted Uses. This evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Notice in a Criminal Case. In a criminal case, the prosecutor must:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) provide reasonable notice of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so that the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) articulate in the notice the permitted purpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer the evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) do so in writing before trial–or in any form during trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.
