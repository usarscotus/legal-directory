1. Any document required or permitted to be presented to the Court or to a Justice shall be filed with the Clerk electronically.


2. A document is timely filed if it is received by the Clerk electronically within the time specified for filing.


3. *[Abrogated]*


4. (a) If the United States or any federal department, office, agency, officer, or employee is a party to be served, service shall be made on the Solicitor General or the Attorney General, or other available employee of the Department of Justice. When an agency of the United States that is a party is authorized by law to appear before this Court on its own behalf, or when an officer or employee of the United States is a party, the agency, officer, or employee shall be served in addition to the Solicitor General or other proper official.


    (b) In any proceeding in this Court in which the constitutionality of an Act of Congress is drawn into question, and neither the United States nor any federal department, office, agency, officer, or employee is a party, the initial document filed in this Court shall recite that 28 U. S. C. §2403(a) may apply and shall be served on the Solicitor General or the Attorney General, or other available employee of the Department of Justice. In such a proceeding from any court of the United States, as defined by 28 U. S. C. §451, the initial document also shall state whether that court, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §2403(a) , certified to the Attorney General the fact that the constitutionality of an Act of Congress was drawn into question. See Rule 14.1(e)(v).


5. Proof of service, when required by these Rules, shall accompany the document when it is presented to the Clerk for filing and shall be separate from it. Proof of service shall contain, or be accompanied by, a statement that all parties required to be served have been served, together with a list of the names and contact information of counsel indicating the name of the party or parties each counsel represents. It is not necessary that service on each party required to be served be made in the same manner or evidenced by the same proof. Proof of service may consist of any one of the following:


    (a) an acknowledgment of service, signed by counsel of record for the party served;


    (b) a certificate of service, reciting the facts and circumstances of service in compliance with the appropriate paragraph or paragraphs of this Rule, and signed by a member of the Bar of this Court representing the party on whose behalf service is made or by an attorney appointed to represent that party under any other applicable federal statute; or


    (c) a notarized affidavit or declaration in compliance with 28 U. S. C. §1746 , reciting the facts and circumstances of service in accordance with the appropriate paragraph or paragraphs of this Rule, whenever service is made by any person not a member of the Bar of this Court and not an attorney appointed to represent a party under any other applicable federal statute.


6. Every document, except a joint appendix or amicus curiae brief, filed by or on behalf of a nongovernmental corporation shall contain a corporate disclosure statement identifying the parent corporations. If a statement has been included in a document filed earlier in the case, reference may be made to the earlier document (except when the earlier statement appeared in a document prepared under Rule 33.2 ), and only amendments to the statement to make it current need be included in the document being filed. In addition, whenever there is a material change in the identity of the parent corporation, counsel shall promptly inform the Clerk by letter and include, within that letter, any amendment needed to make the statement current.


7. In addition to the filing requirements set forth in this Rule, all filers who are represented by counsel must submit documents to the Court’s electronic filing system in conform­ity with the guidelines for the Supreme Court’s Electronic Filing System.
