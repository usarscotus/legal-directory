&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Excited Utterance. A statement relating to a startling event or condition, made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement that it caused.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Then-Existing Mental, Emotional, or Physical Condition. A statement of the declarant’s then-existing state of mind (such as motive, intent, or plan) or emotional, sensory, or physical condition (such as mental feeling, pain, or bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the validity or terms of the declarant’s will.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Statement Made for Medical Diagnosis or Treatment. A statement that:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) is made for — and is reasonably pertinent to — medical diagnosis or treatment; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Recorded Recollection. A record that:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) is on a matter the witness once knew about but now cannot recall well enough to testify fully and accurately;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) was made or adopted by the witness when the matter was fresh in the witness’s memory; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) making the record was a regular practice of that activity;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) all these conditions are shown by the testimony of the custodian or another qualified witness, or by a certification that complies with Rule 902(11) or (12) or with a statute permitting certification; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Absence of a Record of a Regularly Conducted Activity. Evidence that a matter is not included in a record described in paragraph (6) if:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the evidence is admitted to prove that the matter did not occur or exist;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) a record was regularly kept for a matter of that kind; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) the opponent does not show that the possible source of the information or other circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Public Records. A record or statement of a public office if:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) it sets out:

&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) a matter observed while under a legal duty to report, but not including, in a criminal case, a matter observed by law-enforcement personnel; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) in a civil case or against the government in a criminal case, factual findings from a legally authorized investigation; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the opponent does not show that the source of information or other circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Public Records of Vital Statistics. A record of a birth, death, or marriage, if reported to a public office in accordance with a legal duty.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Absence of a Public Record. Testimony — or a certification under Rule 902 — that a diligent search failed to disclose a public record or statement if:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the testimony or certification is admitted to prove that


&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the record or statement does not exist; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) a matter did not occur or exist, if a public office regularly kept a record or statement for a matter of that kind; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) in a criminal case, a prosecutor who intends to offer a certification provides written notice of that intent at least 14 days before trial, and the defendant does not object in writing within 7 days of receiving the notice — unless the court sets a different time for the notice or the objection.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) Records of Religious Organizations Concerning Personal or Family History.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) a statute authorizes recording documents of that kind in that office.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(15) Statements in Documents That Affect an Interest in Property. A statement contained in a document that purports to establish or affect an interest in property if the matter stated was relevant to the document’s purpose — unless later dealings with the property are inconsistent with the truth of the statement or the purport of the document.
