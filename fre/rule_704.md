(a) In General â€” Not Automatically Objectionable. An opinion is not objectionable just because it embraces an ultimate issue.


(b) Exception. In a criminal case, an expert witness must not state an opinion about whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state or condition that constitutes an element of the crime charged or of a defense. Those matters are for the trier of fact alone.
