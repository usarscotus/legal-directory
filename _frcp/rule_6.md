(a) Computing Time. The following rules apply in computing any time period specified in these rules, in any local rule or court order, or in any statute that does not specify a method of computing time.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Period Stated in Days or a Longer Unit. When the period is stated in days or a longer unit of time:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) exclude the day of the event that triggers the period;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) count every day, including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Period Stated in Hours. When the period is stated in hours:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) begin counting immediately on the occurrence of the event that triggers the period;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) count every hour, including hours during intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) if the period would end on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the same time on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Inaccessibility of the Clerk's Office. Unless the court orders otherwise, if the clerk's office is inaccessible:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) on the last day for filing under Rule 6(a)(1) , then the time for filing is extended to the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) during the last hour for filing under Rule 6(a)(2) , then the time for filing is extended to the same time on the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) “Last Day” Defined. Unless a different time is set by a statute, local rule, or court order, the last day ends:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) for electronic filing, at midnight in the court's time zone; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) for filing by other means, when the clerk's office is scheduled to close.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) “Next Day” Defined. The “next day” is determined by continuing to count forward when the period is measured after an event and backward when measured before an event.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) “Legal Holiday” Defined. “Legal holiday” means:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the day set aside by statute for observing New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth National Independence Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans’ Day, Thanksgiving Day, or Christmas Day;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) any day declared a holiday by the President or Congress; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) for periods that are measured after an event, any other day declared a holiday by the state where the district court is located.


(b) Extending Time.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In General. When an act may or must be done within a specified time, the court may, for good cause, extend the time:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) with or without motion or notice if the court acts, or if a request is made, before the original time or its extension expires; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) on motion made after the time has expired if the party failed to act because of excusable neglect.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Exceptions. A court must not extend the time to act under Rules 50(b) and (d) , 52(b) , 59(b) , (d), and (e), and 60(b) .


(c) Motions, Notices of Hearing, and Affidavits.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In General. A written motion and notice of the hearing must be served at least 14 days before the time specified for the hearing, with the following exceptions:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) when the motion may be heard ex parte;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) when these rules set a different time; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) when a court order—which a party may, for good cause, apply for ex parte—sets a different time.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Supporting Affidavit. Any affidavit supporting a motion must be served with the motion. Except as Rule 59(c) provides otherwise, any opposing affidavit must be served at least 7 days before the hearing, unless the court permits service at another time.


(d) Additional Time After Certain Kinds of Service. When a party may or must act within a specified time after being served and service is made under Rule 5(b)(2)(C) (mail), (D) (leaving with the clerk), or (F) (other means consented to), 3 days are added after the period would otherwise expire under Rule 6(a) .
