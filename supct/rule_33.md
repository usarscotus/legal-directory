1. Booklet Format:


&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Except for a document expressly permitted by these Rules to be submitted on 8Â½- by 11-inch paper, see, e. g., Rules 21 , 22 , and 39 , every document filed with the Court shall be prepared using using a standard typesetting process (e. g., hot metal, photocomposition, or computer typesetting) to produce text printed in typographic (as opposed to typewriter) characters. The process used must produce a clear, black image on white paper. The text must be reproduced with a clarity that equals or exceeds the output of a laser printer.
