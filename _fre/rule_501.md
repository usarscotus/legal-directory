The common law — as interpreted by United States courts in the light of reason and experience — governs a claim of privilege unless any of the following provides otherwise:


* the United States Constitution;
* a federal statute; or
* rules prescribed by the Supreme Court.


But in a civil case, state law governs privilege regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision.
