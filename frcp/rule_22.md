(a) Grounds.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) By a Plaintiff. Persons with claims that may expose a plaintiff to double or multiple liability may be joined as defendants and required to interplead. Joinder for interpleader is proper even though:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the claims of the several claimants, or the titles on which their claims depend, lack a common origin or are adverse and independent rather than identical; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the plaintiff denies liability in whole or in part to any or all of the claimants.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) By a Defendant. A defendant exposed to similar liability may seek interpleader through a crossclaim or counterclaim.


(b) Relation to Other Rules and Statutes. This rule supplements—and does not limit—the joinder of parties allowed by Rule 20 . The remedy this rule provides is in addition to—and does not supersede or limit—the remedy provided by 28 U.S.C. §§1335 , 1397 , and 2361 . An action under those statutes must be conducted under these rules.
