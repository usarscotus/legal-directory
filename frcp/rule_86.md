(a) In General. These rules and any amendments take effect at the time specified by the Supreme Court, subject to 28 U.S.C. §2074 . They govern:


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) proceedings in an action commenced after their effective date; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) proceedings after that date in an action then pending unless:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the Supreme Court specifies otherwise; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the court determines that applying them in a particular action would be infeasible or work an injustice.


(b) December 1, 2007 Amendments. If any provision in Rules 1–5.1, 6–73, or 77–86 conflicts with another law, priority in time for the purpose of 28 U.S.C. §2072(b) is not affected by the amendments taking effect on December 1, 2007.
