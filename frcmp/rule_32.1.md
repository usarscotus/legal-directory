(a) Initial Appearance.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Person In Custody. A person held in custody for violating probation or supervised release must be taken without unnecessary delay before a magistrate judge.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) If the person is held in custody in the district where an alleged violation occurred, the initial appearance must be in that district.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) If the person is held in custody in a district other than where an alleged violation occurred, the initial appearance must be in that district, or in an adjacent district if the appearance can occur more promptly there.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Upon a Summons. When a person appears in response to a summons for violating probation or supervised release, a magistrate judge must proceed under this rule.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Advice. The judge must inform the person of the following:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the alleged violation of probation or supervised release;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the person's right to retain counsel or to request that counsel be appointed if the person cannot obtain counsel; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) the person's right, if held in custody, to a preliminary hearing under Rule 32.1(b)(1) .


&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Appearance in the District With Jurisdiction. If the person is arrested or appears in the district that has jurisdiction to conduct a revocation hearing—either originally or by transfer of jurisdiction—the court must proceed under Rule 32.1(b) –(e).


&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Appearance in a District Lacking Jurisdiction. If the person is arrested or appears in a district that does not have jurisdiction to conduct a revocation hearing, the magistrate judge must:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) if the alleged violation occurred in the district of arrest, conduct a preliminary hearing under Rule 32.1(b) and either:


(i) transfer the person to the district that has jurisdiction, if the judge finds probable cause to believe that a violation occurred; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) dismiss the proceedings and so notify the court that has jurisdiction, if the judge finds no probable cause to believe that a violation occurred; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) if the alleged violation did not occur in the district of arrest, transfer the person to the district that has jurisdiction if:


(i) the government produces certified copies of the judgment, warrant, and warrant application, or produces copies of those certified documents by reliable electronic means; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the judge finds that the person is the same person named in the warrant.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Release or Detention. The magistrate judge may release or detain the person under 18 U.S.C. §3143(a)(1) pending further proceedings. The burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the person will not flee or pose a danger to any other person or to the community rests with the person.


(b) Revocation.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Preliminary Hearing.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) In General . If a person is in custody for violating a condition of probation or supervised release, a magistrate judge must promptly conduct a hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a violation occurred. The person may waive the hearing.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Requirements . The hearing must be recorded by a court reporter or by a suitable recording device. The judge must give the person:


(i) notice of the hearing and its purpose, the alleged violation, and the person's right to retain counsel or to request that counsel be appointed if the person cannot obtain counsel;


&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) an opportunity to appear at the hearing and present evidence; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) upon request, an opportunity to question any adverse witness, unless the judge determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Referral. If the judge finds probable cause, the judge must conduct a revocation hearing. If the judge does not find probable cause, the judge must dismiss the proceeding.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Revocation Hearing. Unless waived by the person, the court must hold the revocation hearing within a reasonable time in the district having jurisdiction. The person is entitled to:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) written notice of the alleged violation;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) disclosure of the evidence against the person;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) an opportunity to appear, present evidence, and question any adverse witness unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) notice of the person's right to retain counsel or to request that counsel be appointed if the person cannot obtain counsel; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) an opportunity to make a statement and present any information in mitigation.


(c) Modification.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In General. Before modifying the conditions of probation or supervised release, the court must hold a hearing, at which the person has the right to counsel and an opportunity to make a statement and present any information in mitigation.


&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Exceptions. A hearing is not required if:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the person waives the hearing; or


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the relief sought is favorable to the person and does not extend the term of probation or of supervised release; and


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) an attorney for the government has received notice of the relief sought, has had a reasonable opportunity to object, and has not done so.


(d) Disposition of the Case. The court's disposition of the case is governed by 18 U.S.C. §3563 and §3565 (probation) and §3583 (supervised release).


(e) Producing a Statement. Rule 26.2(a) –(d) and (f) applies at a hearing under this rule. If a party fails to comply with a Rule 26.2 order to produce a witness's statement, the court must not consider that witness's testimony.
