Ordinarily, the court determines whether the proponent has fulfilled the factual conditions for admitting other evidence of the content of a writing, recording, or photograph under Rule 1004 or 1005. But in a jury trial, the jury determines — in accordance with Rule 104(b) — any issue about whether:


(a) an asserted writing, recording, or photograph ever existed;


(b) another one produced at the trial or hearing is the original; or


(c) other evidence of content accurately reflects the content.
